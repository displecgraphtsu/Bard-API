## How to Improve Your 3ds Max 7 Skills with Tips and Tricks
  
3ds Max 7 is a versatile software that can help you create amazing 3D graphics, but it also has a lot of features and options that can be overwhelming for beginners or even experienced users. That's why it's useful to learn some tips and tricks that can speed up your workflow, enhance your results, and make your life easier.
  
Here are some of the best tips and tricks that you can use in 3ds Max 7 to improve your skills and productivity:
  
- Use the Rename Objects tool to rename several objects at once. This can help you organize your scene and find objects faster. You can access this tool by going to Tools > Rename Objects or pressing CTRL + N.
- Disable autobackup when working on complicated scenes to help avoid crashing. Autobackup is a feature that saves your scene automatically every few minutes, but it can also slow down your performance and cause errors. You can disable it by going to Customize > Preferences > Files and unchecking Enable Auto Backup.
- Save incrementally to keep a record of progress. Instead of saving over the same file every time, you can save different versions of your scene with different names or numbers. This can help you recover from mistakes, compare different options, or go back to a previous stage. You can save incrementally by going to File > Save As or pressing CTRL + ALT + S.
- Insert camera at perspective view by pressing CTRL + C. This is a quick way to create a camera that matches your current perspective view. You can then adjust the camera settings or animate it as you wish.
- Use ALT + X to turn selected object transparent. Repeat to remove. This is a handy feature that lets you see through an object without changing its material or rendering settings. You can use this to check for intersections, align objects, or hide parts of your scene temporarily.
- Use ALT + Q to isolate a selected object. This will hide all other objects in your scene except the one you selected. You can use this to focus on a specific object or edit it without distractions. To exit isolation mode, press ALT + Q again.
- Assign hot keys for common tasks. Hot keys are keyboard shortcuts that let you access tools or commands faster than using menus or icons. 3ds Max 7 has some default hot keys, such as Q, W, E, and R for Select, Move, Rotate, Scale, but you can also create your own hot keys for any action you want. You can assign hot keys by going to Customize > Customize User Interface > Keyboard.
- Speed up workflow by setting objects to \"Display as Box.\" This will show your objects as simple boxes instead of their actual geometry in the viewport. This can improve your viewport speed and performance, especially when working with high-poly models or complex scenes. You can set objects to display as box by going to Properties > Display Properties > Display as Box.
- Press 7 to display polys and verts count. This will show you how many polygons and vertices are in your scene or selected object in the viewport. This can help you optimize your scene and avoid unnecessary geometry that can slow down your rendering or animation.
- Increase scene undo level to step back further. Scene undo is a feature that lets you undo or redo your actions in 3ds Max 7. By default, you can undo up to 20 actions, but you can increase this number if you want more flexibility or safety. You can increase scene undo level by going to Customize > Preferences > General and changing Undo Levels.

These are just some of the many tips and tricks that you can use in 3ds Max 7 to improve your skills and productivity. By learning these shortcuts and features, you can save time, avoid errors, and create better 3D graphics with 3ds Max 7.
